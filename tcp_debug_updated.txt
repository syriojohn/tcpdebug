# Check-TCP-Connections.ps1
# Monitors all TCP connections to specified ports on this server, regardless of which local IP/interface is used.
# Loops every 10 seconds and displays detailed connection info, including process name.
#
# How it works:
# - Scans all TCP connections on the server.
# - Filters for connections where the local port matches any of your target ports (e.g., 7077, 9099, 8088).
# - Shows connections on any local IP address (not just localhost), so you see connections from remote clients as well as local ones.
# - Displays local/remote addresses and ports, connection state, process ID, and process name.
# - Refreshes every 10 seconds, clearing the screen for readability.
